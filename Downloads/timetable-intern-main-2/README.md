# TimeTable-Automation For Universities

## Introduction
  This project presents an automated system designed to help universities generate conflict-free
  timetables using constraint-based logic and optimization algorithms. The objective is to streamline
  scheduling while accommodating the diverse needs of students, instructors, and administrators.

## System Features
- Automatic schedule generation using constraint-solving techniques.
- Conflict detection and avoidance across personnel, rooms, and times.
- Time-specific scheduling for practical sessions.
- Inclusion of backlog courses in non-conflicting slots.
- Real-time updates and export functionality.

## Technologies Used
- Frontend: React, Tailwind
- Backend: Express, Node
- Logic: C++, Google OR-Tools
